/*
 * Scene billboards: world-space fans queued per frame via
 * AeronScene_AddBillboard and drawn inside AeronScene_Render at their
 * stage (SKY under the meshes, OVERLAY over them), batched into one
 * VB / one draw per consecutive
 * (texture, blend) run, aux attachments write-masked, with optional
 * flat depth bias and motion-blur velocity stamping.
 *
 * No game vocabulary lives here — engine glows, backdrops, flares and
 * sparks are game-side policies that submit fans.
 *
 * Shaders: scene_billboard3d(.vert/.frag), scene_billboard3d_vel.

 *             velocity-stamped.
 *   OVERLAY — after the opaque mesh walk (glows, explosions, sprites);
 *             depth-tested against the scene, no write; participates
 *             in the velocity prepass when prev corners are given.
 *   LENS    — lens-artifact quads (flare trains): drawn in a dedicated
 *             pass AFTER the scene passes (and the motion-blur
 *             resolve) into the final scene RT, before the game's
 *             bloom/present consume it. No depth test — always on
 *             top — but the whole quad's color is scaled by the
 *             visibility of `anchor_world` sampled from the scene
 *             depth buffer (soft 5x5 kernel; anchors off-frame or
 *             behind the camera fade to zero). Never velocity-
 *             stamped; depth_bias_view ignored. */

 *
 * colors are linear RGBA, HDR values allowed (emissive boost).
 * center_position optionally overrides the corner-average fan center;
 * NULL derives it from the corners. This preserves asymmetric fans whose
 * center is not the centroid of their rim.
 * center_color optionally overrides the fan-center color (XWA glow
 * core); NULL = corner average. depth_bias_view pushes the TEST depth
 * toward the camera in view units without moving the sprite (classic
 * flat-vs-mesh rules); 0 = none. prev_corners enables motion-blur
 * velocity stamping in the prepass; NULL = no own-velocity.

 * submissions sharing (texture, blend) batch into one draw. */
